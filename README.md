# Universe Builder

A fiction world-building toolkit for Obsidian: characters, locations, groups, lore entries, and timeline events.  This plugin is a fork of World Builder originally authored by wesswart77.  It has been adapted to work well outside of a fantasy setting and instead puts an emphasis on sci-fi.

## Features

- **Characters** — name, role, age, group, ship, home, physical description, personality, goals
- **Locations** — name, type, parent location, description, inhabitants, secrets
- **Groups** — name, type, subsidiary of, alignment, goals, enemies, allies, description
- **Lore Entries** — title, category (history/tech/religion/culture/other), content
- **Timeline Events** — date/era, title, description, linked characters/locations
- **World Sidebar** — tabbed view across all five entry types
- **Bookmarks** — bookmark any entry from its expanded view, and open them all from the **Bookmarks** button beside the sidebar's title
- **10 languages** — English, Español, Português, Português (Brasil), Français, Deutsch, Русский, Українська, 简体中文 and 日本語. The sidebar, forms, messages, commands and settings follow Obsidian's language, or the **Language** setting
- **Search** — a search bar pinned under the section header on every tab (each tab keeps its own text); type to hide whatever doesn't match, all words must match. Characters are matched on name, group, ship and home; the other tabs on the name and the text of the note
- **Novel scene editor** — notes in the main editor with both `novelr-type` and `novelr-status` properties open in Live Preview with a toolbar above the text: **Characters**, **Locations**, **Groups**, **Lore** and **Timeline** on the left (each opens a menu of that sidebar section's entries to add to the scene; you can also drag any card from the sidebar, or the header of an expanded card, anywhere onto the scene to add it; the chosen ones show as labels, with their portraits, under the toolbar that open their entry in the sidebar when clicked, and are saved as links in the `universe-builder-scene-characterlist`, `-locationlist`, `-grouplist`, `-lorelist` and `-timelinelist` properties), an optional **Properties** button (a floating panel to edit, add and remove properties, instead of the properties block at the top of the note), bold / italic / underline / strikethrough and align left / center / right in the middle, and the word count on the right. With nothing selected, formatting applies to the word the cursor is in or touching. Alignment is stored as a hidden comment at the end of the line (`%%align:center%%`), so other apps just show the paragraph left-aligned

## Settings

Requires Obsidian 1.13.0 or later. Settings are declared with Obsidian's declarative settings API, so all of them appear in the Settings search box.

- **Language** — the language the plugin is shown in: **Automatic** (the default) follows Obsidian's own language (Settings › General › Language), or pick one of the plugin's languages to override it. Falls back to English when Obsidian is set to a language the plugin hasn't been translated into
- **Universe folder** — where all Universe Builder notes are stored (default: `UniverseBuilder`). Changing it doesn't move existing notes
- **Sidebar editor** — what the Edit button on an expanded entry opens: **Live Preview** (Obsidian's own editor, the default) or **Raw markdown** (a plain text box holding the whole file, frontmatter included). See [Undocumented Obsidian API](https://github.com/liamhatherton/universe-builder/blob/main/UNDOCUMENTED-API.md)
- **Novel scene editor** — turns the novel scene editor on or off (on by default). While it's on: **Required properties** (the properties a note must all have, default `novelr-type, novelr-status`), **Open in Live Preview**, **Show Properties button** (off by default), **Hide inline properties** and **Show word count**

## Privacy

- **Clipboard** — the plugin only writes to the clipboard, and only when you right-click selected text in an expanded card's preview and choose **Copy**. It never reads the clipboard
- **Network** — the plugin makes no network requests
- **Files outside the vault** — read only when you drop or choose an image for a portrait; the image is copied into the vault and nothing outside it is changed
